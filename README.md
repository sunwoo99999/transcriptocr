AutoGrade OCR is a lightweight tool designed to help students (and teachers) calculate the scores they need on upcoming exams â€” just by analyzing a screenshot of their grade summary.
Instead of typing scores into a calculator manually, this tool uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images and process the data automatically.
